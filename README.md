# Intro-to-Python-7

This project helps you develop a Python-based tool to easily divide restaurant bills equally. Input the number of friends and the total bill amount, and the app calculates each person's share. No more awkward calculations or uneven splits! The app handles cases where someone is feeling generous and wants to be the "lucky one" and not contribute to the bill.
